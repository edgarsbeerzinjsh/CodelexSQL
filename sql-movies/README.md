# ðŸŽ¬ SQL Movies

Exercise goal is to create a valid database structure and store data about the movies.

You will learn:

 - database structure design;
 - integrity constraints;
 - executing queries;

## Source Data [@_data](./_data)

Before the exercise go through the data in `.csv` files, they can be opened with *Excel* / *LibreOffice* / etc.

`movies.csv` contains information about the movies, together with directors, actors and other information.

`ratings.csv` contains information about ratings which where left for each movie by users.

### Parsing

Parsing is already done and you don't need to do anything, take a look [./src/data](./src/data) & [./test/data](./test/data)

## Running Tests

Tests are in [./test](./test) directory, work on them in ascending order.

Each test is creating a new database file from the previous test file and storing it in the [./_db](./_db) directory. Which means that you may want to move some steps backwards also, even if all the tests were green.

To run test execute `npm run test-xx` where `xx` is test prefix, for example `npm run test-00`. Take a look if the database file was created.

### 00: Connectivity Check

If test is green you are ready to go!

### 01: Create Tables

To store all the information from the source files we will need tables, but you may have noticed that there are lots of nested information in the `movies.csv` file. Tables are built a little bit differently, we will have separate tables for directors, actors, etc.

Make all the tests green by writing correct statements for database creation.

Table can be created by using a simple [SQL Statement](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp).

There are multiple things to keep in mind:

1. Each of the column must have a proper datatype, see [SQLite Datatypes](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html).
1. Each table must have a [primary key](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp).
1. Think about which of the columns cannot be `null` in any circumstances, add [NOT NULL Constraints](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_notnull.asp).
1. These tables are quite big, for example `ratings.csv` has more than 1 million records, you may want to add an [index](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2955459/what-is-an-index-in-sql) to some tables.
1. Are there any columns or combination of columns which must be unique? Try adding [unique index](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_create_unique_index.asp).

When test is green, open database file in DBVis to see a database structure.

### 02: Insert Flat Data

Now our tables are ready, but there is no data.

Write proper `insert` statements to fill the data. All of the inserts are in batches ([there is a limit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15858466/limit-on-multiple-rows-insert)), you need to [insert multiple values at once](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/452859/inserting-multiple-rows-in-a-single-sql-query).

When you have this test green, open database file in SQLite Browser and try to execute few queries to see that everything works fine.

### 03: Insert Combined Data

This step is very similar to the previous one, we need to insert data from `reviews.csv`. This will be a little bit trickier, because each review is given to a movie from the `movies` table.

### 04: Create Relationship Tables

Create tables which *stick* together our existing tables.

You may want to repeat about Relationships in Database Design, for example [here @database.guide](https://database.guide/the-3-types-of-relationships-in-database-design/)

### 05: Insert Relationship Data

Fill created relationship tables with the data.

### 06: Simple Queries

Simple queries.

If you are stuck check out examples [@sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net) and [@w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

### 07: Queries Across Tables

More complex queries, mainly `joins` between tables.

If you are stuck check out examples [@sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net) and [@w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

### 08: Integrity

Can movie review exist without the movie?
