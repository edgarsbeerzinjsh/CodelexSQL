 One of the first things shop-owners new to Shopify tell us is that they can't believe there isn't a category system. Now with Categories Uncomplicated you can organise your collections into a structure that at a glance helps your customers understand:
* What kinds of products you sell
* How those products are organised
* How they can narrow their search down to more specific sub-categories and find the group of products they're shopping for 
 3-in-1 bundle of products 
 Categories Uncomplicated includes:
* Category list: a category list for your left-hand sidebar
* Breadcrumbs: a full breadcrumb to show on collections or product pages
* Icons: sub-category icons to show in each parent collection 

 Our Demo site shows all the features of Categories Uncomplicated in a live shop environment.  There's also a combined product tour that covers all the bundled products:
https://uncomplicated.myshopify.com/collections/technology-computers#tour-catlist-start 
 Suitability 
 The category list needs to be embedded somewhere on your site, which requires a basic HTML/CSS coding knowledge. We strongly recommend choosing a theme with a sidebar, selecting the place for your category list, then cut-and-pasting the embed. 

 We regret we cannot offer a service to embed this for you in your store or customise your theme to make the category list look different. If it turns out that your theme is lacking or you're not comfortable editing themes, you might like to take a look at our sister apps that require no coding whatsoever: 

 
 Menus Uncomplicated, which shows the same category list in the menu navigation and 
 Floating Category List, which floats over the left-hand side of the page (without a sidebar) 
 
 Visitors and Search 
 Categories Uncomplicated isn't just about helping existing visitors become more valuable customers, it enables you to better present your products to search engines: 
 Create categories and sub-categories 
 with unique hierarchical URLs that allow search engines to index groups of your products in context. 
 Specialise each category (a collection) 
 with custom header text that explains what it's about.  Show product counts against each of your categories so customers can quickly see where your catalogue is fullest. 
 Use the existing Shopify 'Navigation' system 
 to create links, then visualise them in the embedded Categories admin panel.  Simply select the top-level category from the menu selector to see a category tree instantaneously. 
 Improve the SEO metadata 
 that you're sending to Google by including dynamically generated JSON-LD to describe the current category 
 Create great intuitive navigation 
 by embedding our pre-built page elements in your navigation.","<div class=""block"">
